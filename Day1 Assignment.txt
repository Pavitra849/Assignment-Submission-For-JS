Q1:Ans
var and let are both used for variable declaration in javascript,
but the difference between them is that var is function scoped and let is block scoped.
It can be said that a variable declred with var is defined throughout the program as compared to let.

Q2:Ans
The tyoeof an array is an object.In javascript arrays are technically objects;just with special behaviours and abilities.
For example,arrays have a Array.prototype.length property,which will return the number of elements in the array.
Arrays also have special methods, e.g. Array.prototype.push() or Array.prototype.unshift().
To differentiate an Array object from an Object object, we can use the Array.isArray() method.

The null value is technically a primitive, the way "object" or "number" are primitives. This would typically mean that the type of null should also be "null". 
However, this is not the case because of a peculiarity with the way JavaScript was first defined.
In the first implementation of JavaScript, values were represented in two parts - a type tag and the actual value. There were 5 type tags that could be used, and the tag for referencing an object was 0. 
The null value, however, was represented as the NULL pointer, which was 0x00 for most platforms. As a result of this similarity, null has the 0 type tag, which corresponds to an object.
